# express-api-blueprint
This express API is a blueprint for future APIs to be developed upon, as this project aims to incorporate all the core features (sessions, JWT authentication, mongoDB, redis, etc) so that any future APIs I develop can clone this repository and focus on their specific function, hence saving development time.
